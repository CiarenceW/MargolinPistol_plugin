# MargolinPistol_plugin
The weakest firearm in the game yet!

Also check out: [MagLoaderThing](https://github.com/CiarenceW/MagLoaderThing), this un-cuts a thing in the Compound that makes reloading big magazines less of a chore  
And [this](https://github.com/CiarenceW/r2_CustomCompoundAmmoBoxes) as well, it adds ammo boxes for modded cartridges in the Compound, with possibilities of adding custom models for them too!  
And [that](https://github.com/CiarenceW/PlaceholderCartridgesReplacer) while you're at it, replaces the ugly cartridge with a cooler one
